       bfhcafw bus

Various utilities for ConnectX interface on BlueField systems. Supports the
following commands:

find    Searches the filesystem for the correct ConnectX firmware image for
        the current system and prints the full path to it.

flint   Automatically selects the correct flint binary, and passes in the PCI
        device path for the ConnectX interface.

        bfhcafw flint query

        is equivalent to:

        (mst)flint -d <BF1 or BF2 PCI path> query

mcra    Similar to flint, automatically selects binary and PCI conf path to
        run mcra.

bus     Prints the PCI bus number for the ConnectX interface.
